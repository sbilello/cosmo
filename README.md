## Overview

WunderGraph Cosmo is a comprehensive Lifecycle API Management platform tailored for Federated GraphQL. It encompasses everything from Schema Registry, composition checks, and analytics, to metrics, tracing, and routing. Whether you‚Äôre looking to deploy 100% on-prem or prefer a [Managed Service](https://cosmo.wundergraph.com/login), Cosmo offers flexibility without vendor lock-in, all under the Apache 2.0 license.

### Why Federated GraphQL?

GraphQL Federation empowers organizations to break down their GraphQL schema into multiple smaller, manageable schemas, each maintained by different teams or services. These individual schemas are then combined into a single, unified graph, ensuring that all teams have consistent access to the data they need. In today's data-driven world, where information is often referred to as the new oil, building a unified API that can be consumed by both internal and external teams is more crucial than ever.

Not all companies start with a federated architecture, Cosmo supports both monolithic and federated architectures.

## Local Stress Testing Setup

Start Infrastructure
```
make edfs-infra-up
docker compose --file docker-compose.sergio.yml --profile dev up --detach
```

Subgraph running:
```
cd demo/cmd/all
go run main.go 
```

The firewall request should appear and it needs to be allowed.

Please note the terminal would not print any console output in case of success


## Apollo Router Setup 

```
cd apollo
```
Installation
```
curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh
```
Execution
```
./router --config router.yml --supergraph supergraph.yml &
```

## Cosmo Router Setup
```
cd router
go run cmd/router/main.go 
```
Please note the terminal would not print any console output in case of success

## Grafbase Router Setup

Installation requires `bun` under the folder `~/.grafbase/bun/bun`


[This](https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/issues/2046#issuecomment-2305165777) is the workaround approach recommended by the grafbase developer

[Download the binary](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases/tag/bun-v1.1.17) for your reference architecture

and copy it under `~/.grafbase/bun/bun` 

Add `~/.grafbase/bun/bun` to your `PATH`


Run grafbase
```
‚ûú cd grafbase
‚ûú grafbase dev &
Grafbase CLI 0.79.0

üì° Listening on port 4000

Run grafbase publish --dev to add subgraphs to the federated graph

- Pathfinder: http://127.0.0.1:4000
- Endpoint:   http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql

‚ùå Failed to compose schema after adding subgraph availability. Errors:
- None of the subgraphs defines root query fields.
üß© Successfully composed schema after adding subgraph employees
üß© Successfully composed schema after adding subgraph family
üß© Successfully composed schema after adding subgraph hobbies
üß© Successfully composed schema after adding subgraph mood
üß© Successfully composed schema after adding subgraph products
üß© Successfully composed schema after adding subgraph test1
```
